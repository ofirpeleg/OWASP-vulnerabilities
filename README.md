OWASP Vulnerabilities Exploration
Project Overview
This repository is a comprehensive exploration of various OWASP vulnerabilities. It aims to demonstrate and mitigate common security threats in web applications, focusing on the categories outlined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).

Technologies and Languages Used
Flask: For building web application backends.
MySQL: For data storage.
React
Python
JavaScript/HTML/CSS

Project Structure
The repository is organized into directories corresponding to specific OWASP vulnerabilities:

Broken Authentication
Security Misconfiguration
Lack of Resources
Each directory contains implementations of both a non-safe application vulnerable to specific threats, and a safe application demonstrating security practices to mitigate those threats. This allows for a direct comparison between vulnerable and secure application designs.

Detailed Project Report
For a thorough explanation of the project's methodology, technologies, and findings, please refer to the Final_project_OWASP vulnerabilities.pdf within this repository. This document provides an in-depth account of each tested scenario, including setup, execution, analysis, and the conclusions drawn.
