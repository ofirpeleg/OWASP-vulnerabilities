# OWASP Vulnerabilities Exploration

## Description
This repository is a comprehensive exploration of various OWASP vulnerabilities. It aims to demonstrate and mitigate common security threats in web applications, focusing on the categories outlined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).

This project provides a practical exploration of common OWASP vulnerabilities within web applications, focusing on demonstrating the risks and the corresponding security measures necessary to mitigate these risks. Each vulnerability covered â€” Broken Authentication, Security Misconfiguration, and Lack of resources is presented through two versions of specifically crafted web applications: one non-secure to illustrate the vulnerability, and one secure to demonstrate best practices for mitigation.

The project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical security knowledge and real-world application security practices by providing hands-on examples.

## Built with
* Flask: For building web application backends.
* MySQL: For data storage.
* React
* Python
* JavaScript/HTML/CSS

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into directories corresponding to specific OWASP vulnerabilities:

* Broken Authentication
* Security Misconfiguration
* Lack of Resources
  
Each directory contains implementations of both a non-safe application vulnerable to specific threats, and a safe application demonstrating security practices to mitigate those threats. This allows for a direct comparison between vulnerable and secure application designs.

## Detailed Project Report
For a thorough explanation of the project's methodology, technologies, and findings, please refer to the Final_project_OWASP vulnerabilities.pdf within this repository. This document provides an in-depth account of each tested scenario, including setup, execution, analysis, and the conclusions drawn.
